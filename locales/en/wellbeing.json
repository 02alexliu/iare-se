    "explanation": "Well being is highly prioritised at the I-chapter. We have different resources for well being in the form of a safety council for amongst other things incidents related to student life at the chapter (contact skyddsombud@iare.nu), you have support from KTH student health as well as this self-help page for stress management. More resources can be found in the link below. We know that studies can be stressful for many people, especially during the exam periods. Therefore, we have been in contact with researchers at Karolinska Institute and Ume√• Univeristy in order to gain access to the following stress management tips. The goal is that these tips will be read from first to last (see All Tips), for example one each day in order to have time to let it sink in. When you have gone through all tips, you can reherse them by looking at the daily tips. Unfortunately not all tips have been translated to English yet. In the meantime you can use google translate.",
